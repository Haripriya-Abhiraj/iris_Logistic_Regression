Title: 

Predicting Iris Flower Categories with Logistic Regression

Introduction:


In the realm of data science and machine learning, the Iris flower dataset stands as a timeless classic. This project, "Predicting Iris Flower Categories with Logistic Regression," embarks on a journey to explore this dataset and apply logistic regression to classify Iris flowers into their respective species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica.

Project Objective:



The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust logistic regression model that can accurately classify Iris flowers based on their distinct characteristics. This model serves as a foundational example of how machine learning algorithms can be used to solve classification problems, making it an ideal starting point for both beginners and enthusiasts in the field.

The Iris Dataset:


The Iris dataset comprises 150 samples, each containing four essential features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
These features serve as the basis for our classification task, enabling us to distinguish between the three Iris species with precision.
